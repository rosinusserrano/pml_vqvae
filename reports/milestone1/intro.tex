Over the course of this machine learning project, we aim to implement a \ac{vq} as introduced by~\cite{vqvae} and to reproduce their results.
To begin, we focus solely on the field of 2D images, specifically using the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In the later stages of this project, we will have to decide to either go more in-depth, working on increasing the models capabilities in this one field, or widening our work over the other modalities touched upon by the paper introducing the model.

For the first milestone, we especially focus on the datasets and a baseline method for subsequent comparison to our final model.

This report is structured as follows: After a short intro into the \ac{vq}, we begin with an overview of the datasets we will use and the preprocessing and data-cleaning steps applied.
The next section describes the baseline method we implement, followed by a section on the evaluation metrics suitable for both these baselines and our future \ac{vq} model.
We close with a discussion of the results of our baseline models, questions we would like to solve over the course of the project and possible real world use-cases of the final model.

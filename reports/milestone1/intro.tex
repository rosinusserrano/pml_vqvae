In the course of this machine learning project, we aim to implement a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)~\cite{vqvae} and to reproduce their results on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.

In the first milestone, we focus on data preprocessing and the implementation of a baseline method for subsequent comparison.
This section will provide an overview of the datasets we will use, the preprocessing steps applied, and the baseline method we will implement. Additionally, we will outline the evaluation metrics that will be used to compare the performance of our VQ-VAE model with the baseline method.

Upon examining the ImageNet dataset, we found that it contains images with highly irregular resolutions, including some very small images, which was unexpected.
As a result, we performed additional data cleaning by removing images that were excessively small.

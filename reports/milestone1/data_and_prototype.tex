\subsection{VAE}

Our version of the VAE follows the same basic structure as the Autoencoder
previosly described. First we use 2 convolutional layers to downsample the
image to $1/4$ of its original height and width. Then two convolutional
residual blocks are applied, each of which contains two convolutional layers.
An important difference of the VAE is that its encoder outputs a random
variable $\boldsymbol{\hat{z}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu_\theta}, \text{diag}
(\boldsymbol{\sigma_\theta}))$. $\boldsymbol{\hat{z}}$ is obtained using the
reparameterization trick, which consists in sampling $\boldsymbol{z}
\sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and then computing $\boldsymbol{\hat{z}} =
\boldsymbol{\mu_\theta} + \boldsymbol{z} \odot \boldsymbol{\sigma_\theta}$.
$\boldsymbol{\mu_\theta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\sigma_\theta}$ are deterministic
outputs of the last convolutional layer of the VAE's encoder. This allows to
optimize the model using the ELBO loss which in turn enables us to not only
reconstruct the input, but to learn a posterior distribution $p(x|z)$ while
the encoder $q(z|x)$ tries to be as close as possible to $p(z)$. Thus enabling
us to generate new dataset samples by sampling $z \sim p(z)$ and then feeding
it through the decoder.

\subsection{Overfitting}

Overfitting in the context of machine learning refers to the phenomenon where
a model instead of learning useful features from the training data, that
generalize to unseen data, it starts "memorizing" the training data. This
leads to bad performance on the test set. While theoretically, this may still
be an issue with autoencoders and VAEs, we have not experienced this happening
when training with normal settings. This is very likely due to the large
dataset size and the inductive bias of the convolution operation.

\subsection{Class differences}

\subsection{What constitutes good features in machine learning}

In classical machine learning, a set of features is "good", if it helps the
model to achieve a certain task. This implies that the features should be
informative, meaning that they should have some predictive value towards our
final goal. In simple regression settings, this is the case if the feature
correlates with the true value. Furthermore it is helpful for features to be
independent form each other. Dependent features could overemphasize their
importance due to the higher frequency. And lastly, features should be simple.
A classical example would be the task of delivery time prediction between two
locations. Here it is advised to use the distance between the two locations
instead of passing a pair of coordinates, which would cause the model to first
extract knowledge about the distance of the locations. Another important thing
to think of is normalization. Features that intrinsically live on a scale
magnitudes larger than other features will have higher impact on the final
output and will therefore be considered "more important" than other features.

The above listed reasons all are due to the fact that traditional ML models
usually are very sensitive to small perturbations which calls for efficient
feature engineering. In modern deep learning settings this is not so much the
case. Here we see that the models generally become insensitive to small
perturbations in the data. Thats why there is generally not much preprocessing
done. Most commonly the data is normalized into a [-1, 1] range.
